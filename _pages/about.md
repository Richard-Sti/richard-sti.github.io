I m a first year astrophysics graduate student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/astrophysics) working with Julien Devriendt, Adrianne Slyz and Harry Desmond. My research interests are in galaxy formation and dynamics, gravitational-wave astronomy and Bayesian inference & machine learning. I obtained an undergraduate degree in [Physics with Astrophysics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/physicswithastrophysics/) from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk) in 2020, out of which I spent one year at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), and a master's degree in [Physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/studies/study-programs/msc-physics/index.html) from the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/) in 2022.
