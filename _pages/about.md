Hey there! I'm Richard, a first year graduate student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/astrophysics) supervised by Julien Devriendt, Adrianne Slyz and Harry Desmond. I am interested in galaxy formation and dynamics, astrophysical tests of gravity, gravitational wave propagation and lensing in the strong-field limit, gravitational-wave astronomy, and Bayesian inference. I also like to go out for long runs whenever I can!


Background
======
I received my undergraduate education in Physics and Astrophysics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk) in 2020. Along the way, I spent the 2nd year on exchange at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/). I then pursued a two-year master's degree in Physics at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), which I completed in 2022.
