Hey there! I'm Richard, a Physics master's student at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), Munich. My interests are in astrophysical tests of gravity and galaxy formation, gravitational-wave astronomy and Bayesian inference. I also like to go out for long runs whenever I can!


Research
======

I have worked on projects spanning gravitational wave astronomy, empirical and machine learning modelling of the galaxy--halo connection and developed a reversible Markov chain Monte carlo sampler. Currently, I am primarily trying to figure out how gravitational wave propagation is affected by strong gravitational fields and to better understand what causes galaxies to stop forming new stars.


Background
======
I received my undergraduate education in Physics and Astrophysics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk). Along the way, I spent the 2nd year on exchange at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), a forming experience that, among others, cemented my resolve to become a researcher. Over the following years I pursued several research projects (in Glasgow, Oxford, Hannover and Munich) to better prepare for a career in physics (but mainly to just have some fun). Today, I am in the final semester of my master's degree at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/).
