Hey there! I'm Richard, a Physics master's student at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/), [Faculty of Physics](http://www.en.physik.lmu.de). In no particular order, I am interested in gravitational-wave astronomy, galaxy formation, and cosmological tests of gravity. I also enjoy thinking about and working on new Bayesian inference tools and machine learning. And whenever I have the time I like to go out for long runs.


Research
======
I have worked on gravitational-wave data analysis, empirical modelling of the relation between galaxies and dark matter halos and co-developed a (reversible) Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Currently, I am actively pursuing two projects. First is my thesis, in which I am working on birefringence of gravitational waves and its possible detection. Secondly, I am using machine learning to understand the primary and secondary scatter in the galaxy-halo connection in cosmological simulations.



Background
======
I received my undergraduate education in Physics and Astrophysics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), from which I graduated with Honours of the First Class and 21.3/22 GPA in June 2020. Along the way, I spent the 2nd year on exchange at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), a forming experience that, among others, cemented my resolve to become a researcher. Thus, over the next years, I pursued several research projects (in Glasgow, Oxford, and Hannover, Munich, Potsdam) to better prepare for a career in physics (but also to just have some fun). Today, I am in the 3rd (out of 4) semester  of my master's degree at the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit채t M체nchen](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/) and I am seeking Ph.D. positions to start in Autumn 2022.
