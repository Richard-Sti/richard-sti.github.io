I am an astrophysics graduate student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/research/subdepartment/astrophysics) working with Julien Devriendt, Adrianne Slyz, and Harry Desmond. I am interested in constrained cosmological simulations, galaxy--halo connection, gravitational-wave astronomy, and Bayesian inference & machine learning.


I hold a B.Sc. degree in [Physics with Astrophysics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/physicswithastrophysics/) from the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk) and a M.Sc. degree in [Physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/studies/study-programs/msc-physics/index.html) from the [Ludwig-Maximilians-University](https://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/). During my undergraduate, I spent one year at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/).
